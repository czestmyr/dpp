 *
 * Arglib is a university project for the course Recommended Programming Practices at the Charles University in Prague.
 * It is a command-line parsing library that supports short and long format options with or without parameters as well
 * as regular arguments (i.e. not options). The parameters can have any of the built-in types - see Type hierarchy.
 * If that was not enough, the user can use inheritance to create new types. The library was created by Čestmír Houška
 * and Martin Bulant.
